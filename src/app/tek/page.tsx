            Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)

          is a cumulative, intergenerational body of knowledge, practices, and
          beliefs about the relationships between humans, plants, animals,
          landscapes, and spiritual systems, developed by Indigenous peoples
          through sustained interaction with their environments. For Rocky
          Mountain tribes like the Blackfeet, Ute, and Shoshone-Bannock, TEK
          encompasses sustainable hunting, fishing, fire management, and
          seasonal migration practices rooted in deep ecological understanding.
          It differs from Western science by emphasizing holistic, place-based
          wisdom transmitted orally and through lived experience.

        <p>
          Established in 1915, the park has evolved from early tourism and
          resource use to a strong commitment to wilderness preservation. TEK is
          implemented in Rocky Mountain National Parkâ€™s current management plan.
          It mainly encompasses visitor activities including but not limited to
          mountain climbing, trail hiking, new roads and visitor centres.. The
          management understands how the animals there rely heavily on the plans
          in the area, especially in the early stages of wildlife, and use the
          TEK concept of sense of place to preserve that codependence.
