          Rocky Mountain National Park rests on the ancestral lands of many
          Indigenous Nations whose deep-rooted ties to this region span
          thousands of years. Long before these mountains were marked by park
          boundaries, Tribal peoples lived with, moved through, and held
          ceremonies across these peaks and valleysâ€”hunting, gathering, and
          sustaining traditions passed down through generations.
